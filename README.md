# Bike Sharing Analysis
> A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available
for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share 
 systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled 
 wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can
 then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

## General Information
 - A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their 
 revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to
 sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful 
 business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes
 to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 
 - Business Goal:You are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available 
 independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary
 with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet
 the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations.Further, the model will be a 
 good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

## Conclusions
- Different regression models are evaluated to predict the bike demand.
- The Gradient Boosting Regression model outperformed others with a R square score of approximately 
  0.8963 on the test data.
- Residual analysis indicated that the assumptions of regression were approximately met.
